## Introduction to MIMIC Clinical Dataset Analysis with SQL

This project utilizes SQL to analyze the MIMIC (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) dataset, a comprehensive collection of de-identified critical care patient records. Containing detailed clinical data from ICU stays, including patient demographics, treatment protocols, laboratory results, and diagnostic outcomes, the MIMIC database offers valuable insights into real-world healthcare delivery patterns. Through systematic data exploration and analysis, we aim to demonstrate how SQL can transform raw clinical observations into actionable knowledge that may inform medical decision-making and healthcare operations.



  
## Project Objective

By analyzing demographic trends, treatment protocols, and clinical outcomes, we seek to demonstrate how data-driven approaches can reveal insights about ICU operations and patient care. The analysis focuses on understanding relationships between different healthcare variables while developing reusable SQL techniques for clinical data exploration. Through this work, we intend to showcase how database querying skills can extract valuable knowledge from complex medical records to support evidence-based healthcare decisions.

## SQL Techniques Used

**Basic:** `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `JOIN`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`  
**Intermediate:** `CASE WHEN`, `ROUND()`, CTEs (`WITH`), `EXTRACT()`, `LIKE`  
**Advanced:** `DENSE_RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `LAG()`, Date math (`INTERVAL`), Nested subqueries

## üîç Key Focus Areas

### 1. üë• Demographic Insights  
- **Profile** ICU patient populations by gender/age  
- **Compare** first-time admissions vs. readmissions  

### 2. üè• Clinical Pattern Detection  
- **Identify** early warning signs (e.g., hypotension in first 6 ICU hours)  
- **Track** abnormal lab results (e.g., potassium levels)  

### 3. ‚è±Ô∏è Operational Analytics  
- **Evaluate** department-specific lab test utilization  
- **Measure** length-of-stay variations by admission type  

### 4. üíä Treatment Analysis  
- **Document** most prescribed medications (geriatric/initial 24h ICU)  
- **Correlate** sepsis diagnoses with mortality rates  

### 5. ‚úÖ Data Quality Assessment  
- **Validate** ICD-9 code mapping consistency  
- **Audit** timestamp integrity across clinical events
